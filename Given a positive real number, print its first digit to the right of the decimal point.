Statement
Given a positive real number, print its first digit to the right of the decimal point.

Example input
1.79

Example output
7

a = float(input()) # 4.789
import math 

frac=math.modf(a) # Using "modf(x)" function we are getting the fraction and integer part as 
                  # a tuple of fraction part in index 0 and integer part in index 1.
print (frac[0]) # 0.789
print (frac[1]) # 4.0

frac1=str(frac[0]) # As our o\p needs to produce the decimal alone so we are converting the fraction tuple alone 
                   # in to a string 
print("First digit after the decimal point is:", frac1[2]) # As our o\p needs to print the value after the decimal point, 
                                                         # we are printing the 2nd index position of the fractional string
